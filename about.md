Hello World! I am Anirvan.
<!--author-->

Born in Hyderabad, I currently live in _namma_ Bengaluru where I work as a remote consultant.

I have been obsessed with motorcycles since childhood. I currently ride Duchess(KTM Duke 200) & Nightfury (Triumph Street Triple 675).
While I lived in Ireland from 2016-18, I owned a BMW S1000R. My current dream bike is the BMW F 850 GS using which I want 
to do a round the world trip.

After riding more than 50k kilometers and having visited 16 countries I can safely say that I love traveling. I love visiting
national parks and hiking. I have been privileged to have completed some of the most iconic day hikes in the world like the
half dome hike in Yosemite national park.

In the near future, I want to continue traveling across India and visit the neighbouring countries in South East Asia and
Central Asia.
